WORKING TASKS
1. Define basic approach
2. Define most promising solution
3. Code & evaluate solution
4. if solution superior to benchmark: DONE

   else: go back to step 2

APPROACH 

Data preprocessing:
- normalize features for similar scaling (0-1)
- hot-one encoded features for year / month / day / hours (or maybe only month / day / hours)
- augment data by adding more features? (examples: squareroot / lagged / (other augmentations) of temperature / solar radiation / (other features)
- add new features by combination of different features
- reduce features? (--> with LASSO regression)
- label test data

Possible solutions:
- Linear Regression (LASSO due to faster computation with less features?)
- Neural Network
